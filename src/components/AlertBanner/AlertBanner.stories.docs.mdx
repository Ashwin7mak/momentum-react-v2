The `<AlertBanner />` component. This component accepts multiple scopes of child-like props:

* `image` - The image associated with this component. This will typically be an `<Icon />` component.
* `label` - The label or message to be displayed with this component. This supports escape codes, such as `\n`.
* `buttons` - One or more `<ButtonCircle />` components to be mapped to this `<AlertBanner />`. These are heavily re-styled for this component, use custom styling with caution.
* `children` - Overrides the `label` prop, this is virtually identical to the `label` prop.
