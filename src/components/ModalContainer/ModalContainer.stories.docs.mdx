The `<ModalContainer />` component. This component is primarily used as a wrapper for other components. When styling this component downstream, be sure to follow these rules:

* When styling the wrapper component for positioning, use the `.md-modal-container-wrapper` selector
* When styling the content component for look and feel, use the `.md-modal-container-wrapper > .md-modal-container-content` selector
* The `style` prop applies to the wrapper only. This is used  for positioning on-the-fly.
